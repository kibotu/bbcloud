## [0.18.1](https://github.com/biokraft/bbcloud/compare/v0.18.0...v0.18.1) - 2026-08-26

A follow-up to v0.18.0, from using it: the upgrade instruction `bb update` printed could not
work, and the new commands' token scope was undocumented.

### Fixed

- *(update)* the Homebrew hint printed a command that fails. `bb update` told Homebrew users to
  run `brew upgrade bb`, but Homebrew resolves an unqualified name against casks as well as
  formulae, and an unrelated cask named `bb` now exists — so the command ended in
  `Error: Cask 'bb' is not installed` and never touched the install it was meant to upgrade. The
  hint now names the formula in full: `brew update && brew upgrade biokraft/tap/bb`
  ([#45](https://github.com/biokraft/bbcloud/pull/45))
- *(update)* a skipped skill now says how to take the new version. Refusing to overwrite a
  locally edited `SKILL.md` is the right default, but after a release that adds commands — as
  v0.18.0 added three — it leaves that agent describing a `bb` that no longer exists, and the
  message said only that it had skipped the file. It now names the way out:
  `bb skill install --force` ([#45](https://github.com/biokraft/bbcloud/pull/45))

### Documentation

- *(readme)* the scope table documents what `repo create` needs:
  **`admin:repository:bitbucket`**, confirmed against a real token to be the only scope that
  permits creating a repository — no combination of the read and write scopes is enough. The table
  now also says plainly that `read:repository:bitbucket` lets you *list* repositories without
  being able to create one, and that `read:project:bitbucket` is a separate grant again: a token
  holding every read scope still gets a 403 from `project list`
  ([#43](https://github.com/biokraft/bbcloud/pull/43))

### Upgrading

If you installed with Homebrew and `brew upgrade bb` failed for you, this is why; use
`brew upgrade biokraft/tap/bb`. If `bb update` reported skipping a customized skill, run
`bb skill install --force` to pick up the v0.18.0 commands — that discards local edits to those
files, so check `bb skill status` first if you want to keep them.

## [0.18.0](https://github.com/biokraft/bbcloud/compare/v0.17.1...v0.18.0) - 2026-08-26

### Added

- *(repo)* `bb repo create <name> --project KEY` creates a repository in a project. It sends
  `is_private: true` unless you pass `--public`, because omitting the field does not reliably
  produce a private repository — the effective default depends on workspace configuration, so an
  omitted value can publish source code. Nothing else is overridden: the scm, fork policy, main
  branch name, wiki and issue tracker are left to Bitbucket and the workspace's own settings.
  Omit `--project` in a terminal and you get a picker; outside a terminal it is an error naming
  the flag, never a prompt that cannot be answered. No git side effects — no clone, no
  `git remote add` ([#41](https://github.com/biokraft/bbcloud/pull/41))
- *(repo)* `bb repo list [--project KEY]` lists a workspace's repositories, narrowing server-side
  by project key ([#41](https://github.com/biokraft/bbcloud/pull/41))
- *(project)* `bb project list` lists the projects in a workspace ([#41](https://github.com/biokraft/bbcloud/pull/41))
- All three take `--workspace`, falling back to `BB_WORKSPACE` and then to the workspace half of
  the git remote, the same order `bb pr mine` uses ([#41](https://github.com/biokraft/bbcloud/pull/41))
- The bundled agent skill now carries the matching rule: an agent never creates a repository on
  its own initiative, never passes `--public` unless the human said the word, and runs
  `bb project list` rather than guessing a project key ([#41](https://github.com/biokraft/bbcloud/pull/41))

### Fixed

- *(api)* a 403 no longer discards Bitbucket's own explanation. `Client::check` returned a fixed
  string for 403 without reading the response body, so the one status where the server names the
  missing privilege was the only one that threw that message away. It now prefers the API's
  `error.message` and appends the scope hint rather than replacing it
  ([#41](https://github.com/biokraft/bbcloud/pull/41))

### New token scopes

`bb project list`, and the picker `bb repo create` shows when `--project` is omitted, need
**`read:project:bitbucket`** — a token without it gets a 403. `bb repo list` needs only
`read:repository:bitbucket`, which existing tokens already carry for `bb branch list`. See the
scope table in the README.

### Breaking (library consumers only)

`api::models::Repository` gained `name`, `slug`, `description`, `is_private`, `project`,
`updated_on` and `links`, so a struct literal that constructed it from `full_name` alone no longer
compiles. Every field is `Option`, so deserialization is unaffected — this breaks construction,
not parsing. The `bb` binary is unaffected.

## [0.11.1](https://github.com/biokraft/bbcloud/compare/v0.11.0...v0.11.1) - 2026-08-12

## [0.11.0](https://github.com/biokraft/bbcloud/compare/v0.10.0...v0.11.0) - 2026-08-11

Two features: comment threads can now be closed and reopened from the shell, and the bundled agent
skill installs itself with a command instead of a `curl` recipe.

### Added

- **`bb pr resolve` and `bb pr unresolve`** — close a review thread once it is answered, or reopen one
  ([#10](https://github.com/biokraft/bbcloud/pull/10)).

      bb pr resolve 42 998877        # asks for confirmation first
      bb pr resolve 42 998877 --yes  # skip the prompt
      bb pr unresolve 42 998877      # reopen it

  Pass the id of the thread's **first** comment — the one whose `parent` is `null`, which
  `bb pr view --unresolved --json` gives you. A reply id fails, and so does a general comment, since
  only inline threads carry a resolution. `resolve` asks a human to confirm and fails outright with no
  terminal attached, so closing a thread stays a deliberate act rather than something a script does by
  accident.

- **`bb skill install`** — set up this repository's Agent Skill for the coding agents in your project
  ([#14](https://github.com/biokraft/bbcloud/pull/14)).

      bb skill install     # detects .claude/, .agents/, .cursor/, .opencode/ and sets them up
      bb skill status      # where it is installed, and whether it is current
      bb skill uninstall

  This replaces the manual `mkdir` + `curl` + symlink instructions. The skill text is embedded in the
  binary, so installation needs no network and the installed skill can never describe flags your
  binary lacks. Claude Code reads only `.claude/skills/`, so that path becomes a relative symlink to
  the `.agents/` copy — the manual link step is gone. Your own edits to an installed skill are never
  overwritten without `--force`, and `bb update` brings unmodified copies forward as the binary moves.
  The whole group works without authentication.

### Fixed

- **`bb update` blamed the wrong service and hid the real problem.** A GitHub rate limit surfaced as
  `bitbucket api error 403: cannot reach the release api` — wrong service, and the API had in fact
  answered. It now reports `release api error 403: github api rate limit reached — 60 requests per hour
  for unauthenticated access, retry after 14:42`, taking the retry time from the response.

- **The Homebrew upgrade hint did not work.** `bb update` suggested `brew upgrade bb`, which never
  refreshes taps, so a freshly published formula stayed invisible and the command reported "already
  installed" while a newer version existed. It now suggests `brew update && brew upgrade bb`.

Note on scope: resolving a thread is now supported, which the v0.10.0 note said it was not — that
changed here, deliberately, and it is gated behind a confirmation prompt. Approving, merging and
declining a pull request remain unsupported and stay human decisions.

## [0.10.0](https://github.com/biokraft/bbcloud/compare/v0.9.5...v0.10.0) - 2026-08-11

Reviewers become first-class: who is tagged, what each of them decided, and which pull requests are
waiting on you ([#12](https://github.com/biokraft/bbcloud/pull/12)).

### Added

- **`bb pr reviewers`** — see and change who reviews a pull request.

      bb pr reviewers 42                  # who is tagged, and what each decided
      bb pr reviewers add 42 alice        # tag someone (comma-separate for several)
      bb pr reviewers remove 42 bob       # untag someone

  Names are matched case-insensitively against the repository's users and its default reviewers. An
  ambiguous name lists the candidates rather than guessing; a `{uuid}` is always exact. Adding
  someone already tagged writes nothing, and removing someone who is not tagged is an error rather
  than a silent no-op.

- **Review-state filters on `bb pr list`** — most usefully `--needs-my-review`, for the pull requests
  where you are a reviewer and have not approved yet.

      bb pr list --needs-my-review
      bb pr list --reviewer alice
      bb pr list --author @me
      bb pr list --review-state approved   # or changes-requested, pending
      bb pr list --state draft             # also --state all

- **A `STATE` column** on `bb pr list` (`Draft` / `Open` / `Merged` / `Declined`), and a `REVIEWERS`
  column that marks each reviewer's decision: `✓` approved, `✗` changes requested, `·` no state yet.

### Fixed

- **`bb pr list` never showed reviewers.** The `REVIEWERS` and `APPROVED` columns had existed for
  several releases and were always empty. Bitbucket's paginated `/pullrequests` endpoint returns a
  reduced pull-request object that omits `reviewers`, `participants` and `draft`; they come back only
  when requested explicitly, and nothing was requesting them.

- **Name lookup could only find default reviewers.** Resolution went through
  `/workspaces/{workspace}/members`, which needs workspace scope that an ordinary repository token
  does not carry. The refusal was swallowed silently, so colleagues plainly visible in the reviewers
  column could not be named. Lookup is now repository-scoped, and a refused lookup warns instead of
  failing quietly.

### Changed

- **Breaking, `bb pr list --json` only:** `reviewers` is now an array of objects — `{"name", "uuid",
  "state"}`, where `state` is `approved`, `changes_requested` or `pending` — and the `approvals` array
  is gone. Both previously emitted empty arrays in every case, so no working script can depend on
  their contents. A `select(.approvals == [])` filter becomes
  `select(all(.reviewers[]; .state != "approved"))`.

Approving, merging, declining and resolving comment threads remain deliberately unsupported: those
stay human decisions.

## [0.9.5](https://github.com/biokraft/bbcloud/compare/v0.9.4...v0.9.5) - 2026-08-11

## [0.9.4](https://github.com/biokraft/bbcloud/compare/v0.9.3...v0.9.4) - 2026-08-11

### Fixed

- *(api)* follow same-origin redirects so `pr diff` works

## [0.9.2](https://github.com/biokraft/bbcloud/compare/v0.9.1...v0.9.2) - 2026-08-06

### Documentation

- describe the steady-state release flow now that the first release has shipped

## 0.9.1

### Fixed

- The release checksum asset was named incorrectly, which made `bb update`'s self-update path and
  the `install.sh` installer unable to verify a downloaded binary.

## 0.9.0

First public pre-release.

### Added

- Pull requests: `bb pr list`, `view`, `diff`, `files`, `commits`, `create`, `comment`,
  `request-changes` and `no-request-changes`. `bb pr view --unresolved` shows only the comment
  threads that still need action, and `bb pr comment` posts general, inline and reply comments.
- Branches: `bb branch list`, filterable by last-commit author or name.
- `bb browse` opens a repository, pull request or branch page without invoking a shell.
- `bb completions` for bash, zsh, fish, powershell and elvish.
- `bb update` checks the latest release and either updates a standalone binary in place, after
  verifying its checksum, or prints the correct command for a Homebrew- or cargo-managed install.
- `--json` on every command, with stdout carrying only the serde value so output is safe to pipe
  into `jq`.
- Authentication with an Atlassian API token stored in the OS keyring. The token is never printed,
  never written to disk, and never sent anywhere except `api.bitbucket.org`. `BB_EMAIL` and
  `BB_TOKEN` cover CI and headless machines.
- Installation via Homebrew, crates.io, `cargo binstall`, prebuilt binaries for macOS (arm64,
  x86_64) and Linux (x86_64, aarch64), or the install script.
